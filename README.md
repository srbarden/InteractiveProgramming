# InteractiveProgramming
This is the base repo for the interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2016 at Olin College.

Our project creates a timeline of Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama's locations over several years using data from news articles.

To run, clone the repo and run timeline_plot.py
