"""  Data Visualization Sarah Barden and Alisha Pegan
 Takes bing search data collected from news sources about Hillary and
  Michelle's travels and calculates additional data.
 New data include:
  1) shorten timestamp of the event to just include month, date, and year
  2) distance from their location and Washington D.C., where we assume is their
  home.
  The data collected ranges from the 1990s to 2017.
